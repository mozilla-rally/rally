We will publicly share research findings and any discoveries that could enable more privacy and control in consumer products.\n\nWe will always inform you of which research partners have access to Rally data and whenever new partners join.  Some research partners compensate Rally for access to our infrastructure and data.  We will always disclose if research partners compensate Mozilla for access to Rally data.",
